# Ryan's Scripts Repo

This is my repository of useful scripts I have created/used in the past, loosely sorted by categories.

Check out the `README.md` files in each folder for more information about the scripts in there. The READMEs won't always be up-to-date (and in some cases, not always present), but they can give a good idea of what to find.
