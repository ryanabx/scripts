# How to use scripts

## Legion Custom Control

This script is used to set/get power limits (SPPT, FPPT, SPL) in a pinch.

## Legion screen setting commands

KDE Plasma has the ability to run a script when a charger is connected and disconnected from a laptop. Using this, we can automatically set 60hz when unplugging, and 165hz when plugged in.

You can find these settings in `Power Management`
